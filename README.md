# A Small React Exercise

---

I built a simple To Do List with React, timeboxed to 2 hours (give or take an hour since I'm rusty).

## Features

- Minimal UI
- Tasks include title and description
- Create/edit/delete tasks
- Tasks are persisted to `localStorage`

## About

This was bootstrapped with Create React App and the UI is inspired by Cultured Code's Things.
